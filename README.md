Welcome to my Web Development Portfolio
=================

This site consists of web developement projects I have worked on recently. These projects make use of the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).

I have not had the chance to do much testing in Safari, so it is recommeneded to use Google Chrome when accessing this site.
------------

This site makes use of the following environment variables:

DB: url for mongodb

BASE_URL: base url (homepage) for website

SESSION_SECRET: secret used to sign the session ID cookie

GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= Client ID for Google OAuth
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET= Client Secret for Google OAuth
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID= Client ID for LinkedIn OAuth
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET= Client Secret for LinkedIn OAuth
